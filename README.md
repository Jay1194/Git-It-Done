# Git-It-Done

## Description
I've developed a web application that employs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. This application utilizes server-side APIs to conduct searches on GitHub based on either username or programming language. Its purpose is to identify open source projects that currently have open issues and pull requests.
